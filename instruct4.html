	<h1>Instructions</h1>
	<p>Due to the online nature of this experiment, we want to best simulate a lab-like setting. We would like to request that you best remove yourself from <strong class="warm">all</strong> distraction.</p>
	<p>We ask that you turn off any external noise source (e.g. music, television), close all other windows open on your computer, ask other people to leave your immediate environment or to not distract you, and to simply concentrate on the experiment at hand. Evidence that you have not followed these instructions could lead to revocation of payment.</p>
	<p>Most importantly, you may <strong class="warm">not</strong> use any assisitive learning aids such as writing down or drawing labels to help you remember. You must pay enough attention so you will be able to remember the labels on your own.</p> 
        <span class="header">To review:</span>
        <p>
        You will learning whether the squares belong to 'A' or 'B' and be subsequently tested on your knowledge for the labels. You must get two test blocks 100% right in a row in order for the experiment to end.</p>
